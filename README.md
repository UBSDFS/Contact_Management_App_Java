Project Name: Rolodex Contact Manager
Project Description
The Rolodex Contact Manager is a Java console-based application designed to manage personal and professional contacts. It demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts including inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism, interfaces, and composition, along with full CRUD operations stored in an SQLite database.
Users can create, search, update, delete, and list contacts by category (Friend, Family, Business).
